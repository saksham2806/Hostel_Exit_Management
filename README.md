## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishi071056/Hostel_Exit_Management.git
```

Move into the project directory:

```bash
cd Hostel_Exit_Management
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it on Windows:

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.

Add the required configuration values:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key
```

Use the exact variable names required by `backend/config.py` and the application code.

**Important:** Never upload your actual `.env` file or expose API keys, database credentials, or JWT secrets on GitHub.

### 5. Run the Backend

From the project root directory:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Backend URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Swagger API documentation:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

### 6. Run the Frontend

Open the `frontend` folder in Visual Studio Code.

Open `index.html` using the Live Server extension.

The frontend will open in your browser.

Make sure the frontend API configuration points to the running backend.

## Database

The project uses Supabase with PostgreSQL for storing application data.

Database functionality includes:
- Student records.
- Pending student registrations.
- Registration OTP verification.
- Warden records.
- Security guard records.
- Exit requests.
- Complaints.
- Exit and return information.
- Digital receipt numbers.

The database tables must be configured in Supabase before running the application.

- JWT authentication is used for protected routes.
- Role-based authorization separates Student, Warden, and Guard access.
- OTP verification is used during registration.
- Sensitive credentials must be stored in environment variables.
- Never commit `.env` files to GitHub.

## Future Improvements

- Improved notification system.
- Enhanced reporting and analytics.
- Better deployment and production monitoring.
- Additional security and audit features.
